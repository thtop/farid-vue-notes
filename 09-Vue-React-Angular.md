## Why Choose Vue.js Over Others?

**Advantagges:**

1. Vue is a progressive JavaScript framework.
2. Offers you efficient tools for building user interfaces of UIs.
3. Users a virtual DOM which allows things to go much faster.
4. Offers integration with other frameworks so you don't have to worry if you're working on something as a team.

## Vue vs React

- They both use virtual DOM.
- Vue uses pure JavaScript while React uses JSX (whici is short for JavaScript and Asynchronous XML.)
- React library is much bigger than Vue.
- Both React and Vue have a place in the Job sector.

## Vue vs Angular 2

- Angular 2 works only with TypeScript (TypeScript is a supperset of JavaScript).
- Angular use regular DOM which makes it comparatively slower than Vue.
- Note: Vue suppoets TypeScript so you don't necessarily need to learn how to use Angular 2 if you don't think it's your cup of tea.
