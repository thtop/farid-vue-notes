**Important Points:** 

- **Declaratiove Rendering**
  - Vue,js is a system that allows you to declaratively render data to DOM using a straightforward template syntax. DOM stands for Document Object Model.
- **Conditionals and Loops**
  - Vue also offers a powerful transition effect system that can automatically apply transition elements when Vue inserts, removes or updates elements.
- **Handling User Input**
  - User input can be handled by Vue because of its reactive nature. To allow users to interact with an app, use the `v-on` directive.
- **Composing with Components**
  - It is an abstraction which enables us to build large-scale applications that are composed of small, self-contained, and often reusable components.
- Note: In Vue, a component  is essentially a Vue Instance that has per-defined options.
